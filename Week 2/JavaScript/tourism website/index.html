    <p>Chandigarh is a union territory and planned city in northern India, serving as the shared
        capital of the surrounding states, namely Punjab to the north, west and the south, and Haryana to the east.
        Chandigarh constitutes the bulk of the Chandigarh Capital Region or Greater Chandigarh, which also includes the
        adjacent satellite cities of Panchkula in Haryana and Mohali in Punjab. It is situated near the foothills of the
        Himalayas, 260 km (162 miles) north of New Delhi and 229 km (143 miles) southeast of Amritsar.

        Chandigarh is one of the earliest planned cities in post independence India and is internationally known for its
        architecture and urban design. The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le
        Corbusier, which built upon earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American
        planner Albert Mayer. Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by a team headed by
        Le Corbusier, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry. Chandigarh's Capitol Complex—as part of a global ensemble of
        Corbusier's buildings—was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO at the 40th session of the World Heritage
        Conference in July 2016.</p>
